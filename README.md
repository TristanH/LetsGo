LetsGo! is a tool to help you and your friends discover businesses that you'd like to go to together.

We provide an interactive map listing all of the nearby businesses. You can generate a private link to share with your friends and then vote on the businesses each of you wants visit. A list with the highest voted businesses appears in the UI, showing where everyone really wants to go. Don't take our word for it, try it out! 

Made for Hack The North 2014 with Sina Ghaffari. We used Django/Python for the backend, messy javascript and typical web stuff for the front end. Our data came from the Google Maps and Yelp APIs. Overall a very fun project and we really think it solved a problem a lot of people have.

To do:

-Save user sessions so they can't refresh and vote again
-Make UI a bit nicer :)
-Display session description nicely

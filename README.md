LetsGo! is a tool to help you and your friends discover businesses that you'd like to go to together.

We provide an interactive map that can help you and your group decide on a place to go. Whether it be for groceries, coffee, food, or booze, LetsGo! allows you to find new businesses to enjoy!

Made for Hack The North 2014 with Sina Ghaffari. We used Django/Python for the backend, messy javascript and typical web stuff for the front end. Our data came from the Google Maps and Yelp APIs. Overall a very fun project and we really think it solved a problem a lot of people have.
